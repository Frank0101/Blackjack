# Blackjack

This is a simplified version of the Blackjack game.

The player can press the "hit" button until he is ok with the points.
Then he can press the "stick" button to pass the turn to the dealer, who try to beat him.
The player wins if his final score is <= 21 and the dealer can't get ah hingher point without being busted.
In case both the player and the dealer have the same points the dealer wins.

*Note: if you run the tests from Visual Studio you need Chutzpah.*
